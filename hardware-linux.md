# Hardware wallets on Linux

The following aims to be a concise guide of what you need to get your
hardware wallet working with Electrum.

If you use the AppImage, that already has all the dependencies and Python
libraries bundled with it, so skip the first two steps.

## 1. Dependencies

Currently all hardware wallets depend on `hidapi`, to be able to build
that, you need:

*ubuntu:*

```
sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev libudev-dev
```

*fedora:*

```
sudo dnf install libusb-devel systemd-devel
```

(Package names may be different for other distributions.)

## 2. Python libraries

Then depending on the device you have, you need a python package
(typically a library by the manufacturer):

### Trezor

```
python3 -m pip install trezor[hidapi]
```

For more details, refer to [python-trezor](https://github.com/trezor/python-trezor).

### Ledger

```
python3 -m pip install btchip-python
```

For more details, refer to [btchip-python](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/btchip-python).

### KeepKey

```
python3 -m pip install keepkey
```

For more details, refer to [python-keepkey](https://github.com/keepkey/python-keepkey).

### Digital Bitbox

The Digital Bitbox only needs `hidapi`.

```
python3 -m pip install hidapi
```

### BitBox02

```
python3 -m pip install bitbox02
```

For more details, refer to [python-bitbox02](https://github.com/digitalbitbox/bitbox02-firmware/tree/master/py).

### Archos Safe-T

```
python3 -m pip install safet
```

For more details, refer to [python-safet](https://github.com/archos-safe-t/python-safet).

### Coldcard

```
python3 -m pip install ckcc-protocol
```

For more details, refer to [ckcc-protocol](https://github.com/Coldcard/ckcc-protocol).

## 3. udev rules

You will need to configure udev rules.
See [electrum/contrib/udev](https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/tree/master/contrib/udev)

## 4. Done

Thatâ€™s it! Electrum should now detect your device.
